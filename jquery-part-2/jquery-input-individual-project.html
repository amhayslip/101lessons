                <h3>Blog, Todo, Comments, whatever... CRUD.</h3>
              
                <p>CRUD isn't just slang for feces. It stands for "<strong>C</strong>reate", "<strong>R</strong>ead", "<strong>U</strong>pdate" and "<strong>D</strong>elete". You can read more about the concept <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">here</a> in detail here, but these are the basics operations of most of your favorite web applications. Think (again) about Facebook and posts... users can create, read, edit and delete posts. Ultimately we want the ability to build applications that can do all of these things, and persist this data in a database. Today we started this journey by building a page where content can be dynamically <strong>C</strong>reated. Yes, it's epic.</p>

                <h4>Movie Buff</h4>

                <p>Using what you learned today about jQuery, create a webpage called "Movie Buff" from scratch that displays users' favorite movies. Enable them to add movies using an input field and submit button. Style it any way you like and feel free to use bootstrap (or not).</p>

                <h4>Movie Buff Extension 1</h4>

                <p>Extensions are optional, so don't stress if you don't get here.</p>

                <p>In additonal to an input that allows a user to enter the name of their favorite movie, also enable them to add a link to the trailer of the movie from youtube.</p>

                <h4>Movie Buff Extension 2</h4>

                <p>Create a Movie constructor function and create a new instance of the Movie using the user's inputted "movie title" and "trailer link". Append the new movie to the page using the object instance.</p>

                <h4>Movie Buff Extension 3</h4>

                <p>A good practice in programming is to make sure that our user interface reflects our data. Each time a new movie object is created, add it the a movies array. Then, create a renderMovie function that get's called when the movie object is created. The renderMovie function should first clear the movies div and then loop through the array and append each movie to the page.</p>

                <h4>Movie Buff Extension 4</h4>

                <p>Add a like button to each movie and keep track of the number of likes each movie has in a counter on the page.</p>
